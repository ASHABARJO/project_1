<p> Celebrating the birth anniversary of the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi,
students of St. Froebel School observed Gandhi Jayanti by organising a
special assembly on 1 October 2021. The special assembly held was
intended to paying heartfelt tribute to the great patriot and statesman
Mahatma Gandhi. The assembly kicked off with Gandhiji's favourite bhajan
Vaishnava Jana To by the school choir. Students recited poems depicting his
sacrifice for the nation. A skit was presented by the primary school students.
The skit presented had a deep impact on students as it reflected the
attributes Gandhiji possessed i.e. truthfulness and honesty. The skit also
recalled a visual metaphor of India's famous champion of peace Mahatma
Gandhi, of the three vice monkeys representing the principles 'see on evil,
hear no evil and speak no evil.' The Principal while addressing urged the
students to stay away from vices such as lust, anger, greed and ego. She
said all human souls are innately good but when man disconnects himself
from his true nature, he lies, steals, cheats, covets and derides others. Truth
and non-violence go hand in hand. This results in awakening of soul and
helps us to live in complete harmony with fellow humans and nature.</p>
